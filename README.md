# AdviseU-App-Web

## Overview

AdviseU-App-Web is the frontend for AdviseU, a web application designed to assist students and advisors at Oregon State University in generating optimal course plans based on degree requirements, preferences, interests, course difficulty, and availability. This repository houses the Next.js application that serves as the user interface for AdviseU.

## Features

- User profile management, including degree details, anticipated graduation date, interests, and preferred course load.
- Course recommendations using a Pinecone vector database for similarity search.
- Comprehensive degree plan and course recommendation system through advanced algorithm techniques.
- Integration with a MongoDB database for course data.
- Server-side embedding generation for real-time query processing.
- Interactive UI built with React and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB (course data storage)
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone (course similarity search)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (deployment)
- **Backend APIs**: Queries MongoDB and Pinecone (using OpenAI for embeddings) for relevant course recommendations.
- **Backend Server**: Scalable C++ server that hosts the degree-plan scheduling algorithm.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18)
- npm or yarn
- Environment variables for MongoDB, Pinecone, and any other API keys
